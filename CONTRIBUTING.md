   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   # Frontend tests
   cd frontend
   npm run lint
   npm run test
   
   # Backend tests
   cd backend
   python -m pytest
   python -m black --check .
   python -m flake8 .
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add SHA-3 hashing algorithm support"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve file upload dialog on Windows"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork** and create a pull request

## Coding Standards

### Python Backend

- **Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Formatting**: Use Black for code formatting
- **Linting**: Use Flake8 for linting
- **Type hints**: Use MyPy for type checking
- **Documentation**: Use Google-style docstrings

```python
def calculate_file_hash(file_path: str, algorithm: str) -> str:
    """Calculate hash of a file using specified algorithm.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to hash
        algorithm: Hash algorithm to use (md5, sha256, etc.)
        
    Returns:
        Hexadecimal hash string
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If algorithm is not supported
    """
```

### React Frontend

- **Style**: Use ESLint configuration
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier for consistent formatting
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Naming**: Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions
- **Styling**: Use Material-UI components and emotion/styled

```jsx
const FileHashingTool = ({ onHashCalculated }) => {
  const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState(null);
  const [hashResult, setHashResult] = useState('');
  
  const handleFileSelect = useCallback((file) => {
    setSelectedFile(file);
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <Box sx={{ padding: 2 }}>
      <Typography variant="h6">File Hashing Tool</Typography>
      {/* Component content */}
    </Box>
  );
};
```

### Commit Message Convention

Use conventional commits format:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/ -v
python -m pytest --cov=app tests/  # With coverage
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
npm run test:coverage
```

### Manual Testing
- Test all affected features
- Verify cross-platform compatibility
- Test with various file types and sizes
- Ensure security tools work correctly

## Security Considerations

Since CyberSafe is a cybersecurity tool, special attention to security is required:

### Security Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
2. **File Handling**: Be cautious with file operations and paths
3. **Dependency Security**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **Sensitive Data**: Never log or expose sensitive information
5. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing system information in errors

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities in public issues. Instead:
1. Email security@cybersafe.dev (or the maintainer)
2. Provide detailed description of the vulnerability
3. Include steps to reproduce
4. Allow time for assessment and fix before disclosure
